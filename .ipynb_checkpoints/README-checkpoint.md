SNN loss on Tensorflow MNIST example which from recently announced paper *Analyzing and Improving Representations with the Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss*. This is not official.See the more details in references below. If you find some error in this code, please issue to this repository

## Tensorflow MNIST example 
All implementations  about model initialization, loss function, training, testings are in `SNNloss_MNIST.ipynb`
